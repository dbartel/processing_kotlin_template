# Processing Template

Gradle-based project for doing [Processing](https://processing.org/) projects in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

Contains a basic sketch setup, some helper extension methods to deal with the Processing APIs in a more Kotlin-like way,
and a Sketch class similar to Quil's [fun-mode](https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-%28fun-mode%29)
